### Task 1
Write a code that will create variables and initialize them with values of
`Boolean`, `Number`, `BigInt`, `String`, and undefined types using (when
possible) literals and constructor functions.

### Task 2
Print all values and all types of those values using `console.log`. Try to use
string interpolation to display the value and type at the same time with a single
`console.log` call, e.g. in the following form: `1000 [number]`.

### Task 3
Carry out a chain of conversions: create a `Boolean` from a `BigInt` created from a `Number`
that was created from a `String`. Start with the value `"1234"`. Is it possible?
